                                      Rewards
Your company has decided to offer a rewards program for its loyal customers.  The rewards program offers three levels, Gold(G), Silver(S), and Bronze(B). Discounts on the customerâ€™s sales receipt are provided in the table below along with additional discounts for only the amount of the purchase over $200.00. A maximum discount amount for any purchase is $30.00. 
Your program should prompt the user for their current reward level and sales receipt amount.
