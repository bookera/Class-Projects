Class projects from my time in community college
                                      Gasoline
Before heading out on a weekend trip, you have decided to calculate your gasoline expenses to determine whether the trip is within your budget. You have the option to fill your 25 gallon vehicle at two different gas stations. You also have the option of using your 2 different credit cards. One card gives you a 3% cash-back bonus. The second card, a gas card at Fill-A-Tank gives you a 4.5% cash-back bonus.
