Class projects from my time in community college

As the manager of Pools, Pools and Pools you would like to create a report that tracks the sales of your employees. You currently have three sales people – Tom, Chris, and Mary. Write a program that prompts the user for a salesperson’s initial (‘T’, ‘C’’, or ‘M’) then allows the user to enter up to 5 sale amounts at a time for the salesperson. Calculate and display the salesperson’s commission as 17% of the sales entered. Add the commission to a running total for that salesperson. The program should terminate when the user types a ‘Z’. A final report should display each salesperson’s total commission earned along with their average sales.
