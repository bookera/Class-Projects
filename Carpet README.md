Class projects from my time in community college
                                      Carpet
You have decided to replace some of the carpet in your house. Having a limited budget, you need to first estimate the cost for the various rooms. Instead of doing the calculations by hand, you have decided to put your C++ programming skills to good use and write a program to do the cost estimations. Your program will prompt the user for the needed information then display the calculated values in a neatly formatted report.
